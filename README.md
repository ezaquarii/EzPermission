# EzPermission

Go straight to [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Handling dynamic permissions on Android is a major PITA, mainly due to the braindead API
design.

This library is yet another helper that makes permission handling easier.

It's based on state machine that handles the user flow.
Pass a code that requires a permission as a callback and invoke it via
`EzPermission.call()` helper. The helper will handle permission flow and call
intended code when permission is available.

# Features

1. single-file implementation, if you want to pull it inside your project
2. based on state machine, so fixing corner cases should be very easy
3. modal rationale (using dialog)
4. modeless rationale (being integrated into screen itself)
5. focused on permission handling logic - doesn't contain any UI code
6. handles permissions revoked at runtime via settings menu
7. handles permissions granted at runtime via settings menu

# Limitations

This library is focused on permission handling logic and it doesn't
contain any UI code.

# Versioning scheme

`MAJOR . FEATURE . BUGFIX`

* `MAJOR` - hardwired to 1, as usual in software versioning :)
* `FEATURE` - increased for new features
* `BUGFIX` - increased for bugfixes only

# Integration

## Dependencies

Add my private bintray repository in your root `build.gradle`:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven {
                url "https://dl.bintray.com/ezaquarii/android"
            }
        }
    }
    
In module `build.gradle`, add a dependency:
    
    compile ('com.ezaquarii:ezpermission:1.2.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support'
    }

## Modeless

Modeless flow is useful in situations, when we can't construct the screen UI without
proper permission. A canonical example of such case is a camera application, where
camera preview occupies full screen.

    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

        companion object {
            @JvmField val REQUEST_CAMERA_PERMISSION = 1000;
        }

        private val mInitCamera = EzPermission.of(this, REQUEST_CAMERA_PERMISSION, arrayOf(Manifest.permission.CAMERA, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE))
                .onGranted{ onCameraGranted() }
                .onRationale{ onCameraRationale() }
                .onDenied{ onCameraDenied() }
                .onDeniedPermanantly{ onCameraDeniedPermanently() }
                .build()
        
        override fun onStart() {
            super.onStart()
            mInitCamera.call();
        }
        
        ...
        
    }

## Modal

Modal flow is probably the most popular one. Permission rationale is shown as a dialog (or similar UI widget),
that breaks the user flow. Once user accepts the rationale, we launch permission query again.

With `EzPermission` this is... well... easy.

    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

        companion object {
            @JvmField val REQUEST_AUDIO_PERMISSION = 2000;
        }
    
        private val mRecordAudio = EzPermission.of(this, REQUEST_AUDIO_PERMISSION, arrayOf(Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE))
                .onGranted{ onAudioGranted() }
                .onRationale{ onAudioRationale() }
                .onDenied{ onAudioPermissionDenied() }
                .onDeniedPermanantly{ onAudioPermissionDeniedPermanently() }
                .build()
                
        // on click handler, attached to some "record" button        
        fun onClickedRecordAudio(v: View) {
            mRecordAudio.call()
        }
        
        // called when permission to use microphone is obtained
        private fun onAudioGranted() {
            toast("Recording audio")
        }
        
        ...
    
    }
            
## What are those callbacks?

Callbacks provided to `EzPermission` are being invoked by the state machine at appropriate
moment. You should consult provided sample to see how to use those callbacks to implement UI
changes (reveal rationale, launch alerts, etc).
